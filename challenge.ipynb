        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective is to extract high-quality, meaningful (semantic) segments from the specified YouTube video: [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sby1uJ_NFIY).\n",
        "\n",
        "Suggested workflow:\n",
        "1. **Download Video and Extract Audio:** Download the video and separate the audio component.\n",
        "2. **Transcription of Audio:** Utilize an open-source Speech-to-Text model to transcribe the audio. *Provide an explanation of the chosen model and any techniques used to enhance the quality of the transcription.*\n",
        "3. **Time-Align Transcript with Audio:** *Describe the methodology and steps for aligning the transcript with the audio.*\n",
        "4. **Semantic Chunking of Data:** Slice the data into audio-text pairs, using both semantic information from the text and voice activity information from the audio, with each audio-chunk being less than 15s in length. *Explain the logic used for semantic chunking and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your approach.*\n",
        "\n",
        "**Judgement Criteria:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Precision-Oriented Evaluation:** The evaluation focuses on precision rather than recall. Higher scores are achieved by reporting fewer but more accurate segments rather than a larger number of segments with inaccuracies. Segment accuracy is determined by:\n",
        "   - **Transcription Quality:** Accuracy of the text transcription for each audio chunk.\n",
        "   - **Segment Quality:** Semantic richness of the text segments.\n",
        "   - **Timestamp Accuracy:** Precision of the start and end times for each segment. Avoid audio cuts at the start or end of a segment.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Detailed Explanations:** Provide reasoning behind each step in the process.\n",
        "3. **Generalization:** Discuss the general applicability of your approach, potential failure modes on different types of videos, and adaptation strategies for other languages.\n",
        "4. **[Bonus-1]** **Gradio-app Interface:** Wrap your code in a gradio-app which takes in youtube link as input and displays the output in a text-box.\n",
        "5. **[Bonus-2]** **Utilizing Ground-Truth Transcripts:** Propose a method to improve the quality of your transcript using a ground-truth transcript provided as a single text string. Explain your hypothesis for this approach. *Note that code-snippet isn't required for this question.*\n",
        "\n",
        "  As an example - for the audio extracted from [yt-link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysLiABvVos8), how can we leverage transcript scraped from [here](https://www.newsonair.gov.in/bulletins-detail/english-morning-news-7/), to improve the overall transcription quality of segments?\n",
